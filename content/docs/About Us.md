is a non-profit organization providing effective educational solutions to students and educators. Weâ€™re a team of like-minded people who work to eliminate roadblocks to learning.

We are a young establishment based out of Pink City consisting of hackers, developers, artists, makers and alike who believe in open education. 

* We run schools.
* We develop apps.
* We design curriculum.
* We organise hackathons.

> We also slay edtechs.

Education has become more business and marketing today than ever before.  We hate how these firms operate and their overpriced offerings. 

* Why is your 7 year learning to code ?
* Why does an edtech raise billions in funding ?
* Why do we see ad walls for content that is otherwise free ?
* Why fraudulent cases have spiked against edtechs ?
* Why are edtechs sued for copyright infringement ?
