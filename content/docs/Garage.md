If you're a people person, this is your thing. You get to meet new people, visit places and make friends while working.

We need volunteers on project basis so if you're interested let us know right away. As a volunteer you work closely with schools on day to day operations.
<--->
Even If you're not good at articulating, you should definitely give this a shot atleast once. Especially because even if you're looking forward to a desk job for life, you will need to communicate to people.

Also going solo is great as it increases your confidence.

Unlike other NGOs, we have a blog on our site. 
This is because we want you to be a close part of the initiative.

With a blog, we keep you updated about ourselves. Our products, services, undetakings, ledger and so on.

Apart from that, we use it to post anything education related, course map, guides, book recommendation etc. We also write about education and the industry in general, it's practices, where it is flawed, related ideas etc.
