Consider donating a few bucks. Unlike edtechs we don't aim to make millions in profit. We're doing this because we like teaching. And without the greed of profit, even small amounts can take us a long way ahead.

Donations to Open Slice go towards our education initiatives, and help pay for services, staff and support development of digital solutions we provide.

The Open Slice board approves the use of donations to fund project-related expenses. We use a transparent ledger, which shows where money comes from and where it goes. You can check out the ledger, projects and other updates at our {{< button href="/posts/" >}} Blog {{< /button >}}
