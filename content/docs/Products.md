{{< columns >}}
Question Bank provides personalised question papers. You start by taking a test.

Based on the test scores the app infers what topics you need to work on, which it reflects on the question set next time you take a test.

This way, your test acts as a diagnostic tool that shows you where you lag behind.

The app can also generate question sets based on tags you provide. And includes previous year questions.
