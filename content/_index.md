> On the cloud

We develop free digital solutions, providing the tools, methods and platform for effective learning to take place. No ads, No data mining, No hidden terms. Pay what you like or don't pay at all.

> On the ground

We work school by school running our services and providing educational solutions to facilitate, catalyse and inspire learning. From setting up labs, to organising events and beyond.

Edtechs today raise funds, hire people and then raise more, until they can shush their competition profiting millions with their overpriced offerings. This race to make profit ends up exploiting students and parents alike. It doesn not have to be like that. Hence, Open Slice.
{{< /hint >}}

We believe in open education for all, open in every sense of the word. While ed tech startups are busy milking riches, and increasing their valuation, we provide an open alternate.
