Weâ€™re a team of like-minded people who work to eliminate roadblocks to learning.
We are a young establishment based out of Pink City consisting of hackers, developers, artists, makers and alike who believe in open education.
We run schools. We develop apps. We design curriculum. We organise hackathons. We also slay edtechs.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/docs/donate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/docs/donate/</guid><description>Donate : # Consider donating a few bucks. Unlike edtechs we don&amp;rsquo;t aim to make millions in profit. We&amp;rsquo;re doing this because we like teaching. And without the greed of profit, even small amounts can take us a long way ahead. Donations to Open Slice go towards our education initiatives, and help pay for services, staff and support development of digital solutions we provide.

Question Bank Question Bank provides personalised question papers. You start by taking a test.
Based on the test scores the app infers what topics you need to work on, which it reflects on the question set next time you take a test.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/docs/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/docs/services/</guid><description>Services # We do sell our services, and raise funds.
